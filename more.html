	<p>This project has been uploaded on github and can be viewed using this link:- </p>
	<p>In Github you can also see the source code of the HTML and CSS webpages.</p>
	<p>We used two softwares to make these webpages. Those are Sublime Text and Microsoft VSCode. Both of them are code editing software and are very efficient(far better than notepad) and hence helped us save a lot time.</p>
